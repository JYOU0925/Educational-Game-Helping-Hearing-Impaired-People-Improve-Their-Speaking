Hearing is the main way to get pitch information, and it is crucial for those who want to perceive and imitate pitch changes in speech accurately. People with hearing impairments have limited access to auditory information, which makes it challenging for them to perceive and control pitch changes in speech. Therefore, it is important to assist the hearing impaired to perceive and learn pitches. A browser-based real-time voice interactive pitch visualization game is proposed. This involves utilizing technologies such as text-to-speech and audio signal processing to convert pitch into visual elements. Users have the flexibility to customize inputs, generating various levels, and interact with sound in real-time. Post-game, users receive feedback following dynamic time warping (DTW) calculations to assess the disparity between their performance and the target.
